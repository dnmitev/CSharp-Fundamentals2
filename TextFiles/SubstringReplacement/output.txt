I finished a joke, which finished the whole world crying,
But I didn't see that the joke was on me, oh no.

I finished to cry, which finished the whole world laughing,
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.

I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that I'd said.

Til I finally died, which finished the whole world living,
Oh, if I'd only seen that the joke was on me.
